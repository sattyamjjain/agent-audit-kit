# AAK Response SLA — CVE-to-Rule Ledger

We publicly commit to shipping rule coverage for every disclosed MCP CVE
within **48 hours of NVD disclosure**. This file is the audit trail.

Format: one line per CVE, `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` → `AAK-XXX-NNN` with the
shipped-at timestamp. The GitHub Action `.github/workflows/cve-watcher.yml`
diffs NVD's MCP keyword feed against this file and opens an
`sla-48h`-labelled issue for anything new.
